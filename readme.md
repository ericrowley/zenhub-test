# Overview
Goal of this repo is to see if we can use Zenhub for a more light-weight project management. This would serve as a replacement Jira. 

## Items to consider with just Project and Isses
- What are we missing from Jira that we must have
- Is this more clear and direct than what we do with Jira
- What's worse
- What's better
